Storage : 

File storage:
1) The storage which stores all your local files inside your computer.
2) It follows Heirarchical model.
	which is nothing but files inside folders and inside folders
3) Path which our file is saved is the location.
4) To share the files from one machine to other we have NAS(Network Area Storage)
NAS :It provide a medium to share the data through shared folder which are connected in same network.

Block storage  : 
It is the most advanced storage.
1. It has lowest latency possible.
2. When ever a file need to stored it break down the file into small blocks or chunks.
3. Block storage adds a middle layer.
SAN - Server Area Network
	SAN is nothing but a OS which could be any type
like windows, linux or MAC
-->when ever user tries to store or retrieve file it goes through SAN.
--> SAN break down the file to equal blocks and it doesn't
store it at one place. It randomly distributes the blocks as per the availability of volumes (Hard disk).
4. Mostly used in Databases and virtual machines.

Object storage : To perform analytics we need object storage.

1) It follows Flat structure.
2) It doesn't randomly distribute the data. It stores the 
data in flat line structure  names repositories.
3) It contains Meta data like File created by Date, time, etc

IBM object storage :Create policy public
To access:https://s3.jp-tok.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/bub/DockerCommands.txt
								bucketname/filename
cloud object storage:
select lite plan
create
Bucket name should be unique
create bucket
upload the files
To connect Aspira
click on upload and select aspira(fastest file transfer)
Install extension and install connect
Now file transfer will increase to X60 times
Convert file to public access.
Go to permissions
Go to public access.
select object reader
Go to configuration
scroll down to find end points
In public copy the endpoint link and add https://
add the bucket name and filename to link
